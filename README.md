# Storage Repository for Project Documents

I created this repository to store documents that I link to from my personal website: [www.skhaniyur.com](www.skhaniyur.com)

## Documents:

- [Forecasting CO2 Levels](https://github.com/skhaniyur/undergrad-docs/blob/master/Forecasting%20CO2%20Levels.pdf) - Forecasted the CO2 levels for every month in 2005 using R
- [Analysis of Vehicle Sales Data](https://github.com/skhaniyur/undergrad-docs/blob/master/Analysis%20of%20Vehicle%20Data.pdf) - Identified anomalies, cleaned data, performed regressions, and processed text using pattern matching and regular expressions using R
